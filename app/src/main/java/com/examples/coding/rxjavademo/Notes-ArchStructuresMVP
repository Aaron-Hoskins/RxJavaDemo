- Architecture Structures
    - Used to help in Maintainability, Reusable, and portability of code
    - Achieved by defining separation of concerns
        - 3 layers
            - view (UI)
                - activities
                - fragments
                - dialogs
                - adapters
                - custom views
                - compound views
            - model (data)
                - pojos
                - data classes
                - data sources
                    - local
                        - Sqlite files
                        - Room DAO, Database file
                        - SharedPref Manager
                        - Utility classes for file access
                    - remote
                        - API calls (REST)
                        - Remote databases (Firebase DB)
                        - Authenication
                    - repository managers
            - logic layer - operational  (biz logic)
                - logic to pull data from datasources
                - logic to manipulate data for viewing
                - background operations
                - ect
    - 3 Major Arch. types
        - MVC
            - Model View Controller
        - MVP
            - Model View Presenter
            - Communication from view to presenter and present to view is achieved via the CONTRACT
                - interfaces
            - The view and presenter have a 1 to 1 relationship
            - Not actively supported by google
            - Model
                - datasources
                - pojo/data classes
            - View
                - Activities
                    - View for Activity
                    - Presenter for Activity
                    - Contract for the activity
                - Fragments
                    - ...
                - Adapters
                    - are controlled via the host presenter
            - MVP (Dagger)
                - Base presenters
                - Dagger 2 Modeles, components, scopes, ect

        - MVVM
            - Model View ViewModel
